# The Grean Deal IoT

Entrepreneurs in Europe and around the world have been given a precious piece of framework from the EU to start working on climate change solutions.

This an opportunity to align policy, resources and solutions around solving climate change. As not always ideas, competences or resources find them selves aligned in place and time, many get lost. And one thing is sure. We are only going to solve this problem with thousands of ideas.

The concept is that we encourage as many entrepreneurs to share their ideas for free. Most entrepreneurs I know have got their 40 hour work week fully booked anyhow.

As an example I am going to start The Green Deal IoT, but let's use the open source mindset and fork a The Grean Deal AI, The Green Deal Big Data, etc.

So read the plan [link] and create an issue for every solution you envision here.

Let's see how far this can take us.
